### Project Description
 The ‚ÄúAre You Sure?‚Äù App
Every time you click a button, it asks: "Are you sure?"
If you click Yes, it asks again with slightly more dramatic phrasing ("But‚Ä¶ are you REALLY sure?").
Infinite loop.Same goes for clicking No. Never lets you complete the action.
Also, for every 5 clicks the screen gets flickering effect, and for every 15 clicks a fake hacking screen for 30s occur.
The web app's wallpaper is fully custumaisable and achivements for playing games are also enabled.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
The app cleverly illustrates the non-existent problem of "insufficient confirmation" in digital interfaces. 
It satirizes the absurd notion that users need endless verification before taking any action, 
highlighting how over-protective UI design can become a form of digital anxiety rather than helpful safety.
The app exposes the imaginary crisis of "decision commitment deficit" - the idea that people are so reckless 
with their clicks that they need infinite layers of "are you sure?" prompts, when in reality, 
most users know exactly what they want to do and are frustrated by excessive confirmation dialogs.
It's a humorous commentary on how we've created solutions to problems that don't actually exist, 
turning simple user actions into theatrical productions of doubt and hesitation.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We've revolutionized decision-making with our groundbreaking "Infinite Confirmation Loop Technology‚Ñ¢"! Finally, 
an app that understands you're clearly too impulsive and need to be questioned about literally everything you do.
Our patented algorithm escalates doubt with each click - starting with polite uncertainty ("Are you sure?")
and building to existential crisis levels ("But do you REALLY know what 'sure' even means?"). 
We've gamified indecision with achievement badges like "Commitment Phobic" and "Master Procrastinator," 
because apparently clicking buttons needed a reward system.
The flickering screen effects simulate the mental strain of making choices, while our fake hacking sequences
remind you that even your hesitation is under surveillance. With fully customizable wallpapers, you can personalize your prison
of perpetual uncertainty! Because nothing says "user experience" like being trapped in a beautifully decorated loop of your own making.
