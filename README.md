### Project Description
 The ‚ÄúAre You Sure?‚Äù App
Every time you click a button, it asks: "Are you sure?"
If you click Yes, it asks again with slightly more dramatic phrasing ("But‚Ä¶ are you REALLY sure?").
Infinite loop.Same goes for clicking No. Never lets you complete the action.
Also, for every 5 clicks the screen gets flickering effect, and for every 15 clicks a fake hacking screen for 30s occur.
The web app's wallpaper is fully custumaisable and achivements for playing games are also enabled.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
The app cleverly illustrates the non-existent problem of "insufficient confirmation" in digital interfaces. 
It satirizes the absurd notion that users need endless verification before taking any action, 
highlighting how over-protective UI design can become a form of digital anxiety rather than helpful safety.
The app exposes the imaginary crisis of "decision commitment deficit" - the idea that people are so reckless 
with their clicks that they need infinite layers of "are you sure?" prompts, when in reality, 
most users know exactly what they want to do and are frustrated by excessive confirmation dialogs.
It's a humorous commentary on how we've created solutions to problems that don't actually exist, 
turning simple user actions into theatrical productions of doubt and hesitation.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We've revolutionized decision-making with our groundbreaking "Infinite Confirmation Loop Technology‚Ñ¢"! Finally, 
an app that understands you're clearly too impulsive and need to be questioned about literally everything you do.
Our patented algorithm escalates doubt with each click - starting with polite uncertainty ("Are you sure?")
and building to existential crisis levels ("But do you REALLY know what 'sure' even means?"). 
We've gamified indecision with achievement badges like "Commitment Phobic" and "Master Procrastinator," 
because apparently clicking buttons needed a reward system.
The flickering screen effects simulate the mental strain of making choices, while our fake hacking sequences
remind you that even your hesitation is under surveillance. With fully customizable wallpapers, you can personalize your prison
of perpetual uncertainty! Because nothing says "user experience" like being trapped in a beautifully decorated loop of your own making.

This screenshot shows a playful and minimalistic confirmation prompt from areusure.vercel.app, a site designed to repeatedly question
your decision. The card in the center asks, "Are you sure?" with two large buttons ‚Äî Yes (green) and No (red). Below the question, 
it humorously says, "Choose wisely‚Ä¶ or don‚Äôt". In the bottom-right corner, there‚Äôs a cheeky note saying, "There is no escape‚Ä¶",
adding to the lighthearted, persistent nature of the site.

This screenshot shows the "Customize Your Experience" settings from areusure.vercel.app, specifically the Wallpapers tab. Here, 
users can personalize the site's background by:

Entering an image URL to Add Custom Wallpaper.

Uploading a wallpaper directly from their device.

Choosing to Use Theme Background Only without any wallpaper overlay.

The interface uses a clean, modern design with purple accents, and the background is a dark gradient theme.


![Screenshot3 -  Confirmation Prompt with Achievements Pane]

This screenshot from areusure.vercel.app features a playful confirmation message saying, "What if I told you this is irreversible? Still sure?", 
accompanied by Yes (green) and No (red) buttons. On the left, there‚Äôs an Achievements panel that visually tracks user progress and milestones
without revealing specific data. The certainty level is displayed below the prompt, and a humorous note in the bottom-right corner reads 
"There is no escape‚Ä¶".

### Project Demo
# Video
https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ASvtNDBvKv4c-ZXdRSnLlSkYNZpSy-sS/view?usp=sharing
This demo video is about the ‚ÄúAre You Sure?‚Äù App ‚Äì a fun and never-ending confirmation game. 
In the video, you‚Äôll see how every button click triggers the question ‚ÄúAre you sure?‚Äù, followed by 
increasingly dramatic variations like ‚ÄúBut‚Ä¶ are you REALLY sure?‚Äù. No matter whether you choose Yes or No, the loop never ends.

The demo also shows special effects ‚Äî a screen flicker every 5 clicks, and a fake hacking screen every 15 clicks for 30 seconds.
You‚Äôll also see how the app‚Äôs wallpaper can be fully customized, and how achievements are unlocked while you play.
